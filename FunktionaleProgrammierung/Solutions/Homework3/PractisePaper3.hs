	I decided I will remove every non-bracket character from the text first and
	then use the given function. I could also just skip the non-bracket symbols
	in the balanced function, but then I would need to use the bigger pattern
	matching, that inlcudes every bracket, otherwise cases like 
	bal stapel ('a':xs) will match the pattern  bal (s:stapel) (x:xs)
	and give wrong results.

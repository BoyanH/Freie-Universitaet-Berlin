Programming tasks completed at "Freie Universität Berlin"
==

Here are some of the tasks I completed while taking the algorithms and programming courses at Freie Universität Berlin. Unfortunately a lot of tasks were solved on paper, others I solved on a random PC at the university, so the list is by no means full. All tasks are uploaded as they were once submitted, no further refactoring was made.

Most of the exercises were in German. Sometimes it was required to use given method and variable names, therefore not all code is always in English.

Programming tasks completed at "Freie Universität Berlin"
==

Here are some of the tasks I completed while taking the algorithms and programming courses at Freie Universität Berlin. Unfortunately a lot of tasks were solved on paper, others I solved on a random PC at the university, so the list is by no means full. All tasks are uploaded as they were once submitted, no further refactoring was made.
